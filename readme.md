# React and React Native Reusable Hooks

This project contains reusable hooks for React and React Native applications. These hooks are designed to simplify and streamline your development process by providing ready-to-use logic for common functionalities.

## Current Hooks

### useSelectableList

The `useSelectableList` hook is designed to handle all the states and actions of a multiple selectable list, such as a FlatList in React Native. This hook makes it easy to manage selection state, providing a simple interface for selecting and deselecting items.

## Future Hooks

We plan to add more reusable hooks to this project in the future. Stay tuned for updates!

## Usage

To use these hooks in your project, simply import them from the library:

```javascript
import { useSelectableList } from 'react-reusable-hooks';
```
